1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React JS solves the issue of state and scalability. With a growing amount of data being stored or data being inputed by more and more people, react tries to tackle the issue of huge amounts of updating and changing of that data.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    Thinking in react means thinking in components. As the react.js team suggests, that a component should only do one thing and if it ends up growing to do more things than it was purposed, then it should be "decomposed into smaller subcomponents". The call this the "single responsibility principle"

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A class components hold state and has the ability to call react lifecycle methods while functional presentation components do not and merely present data given.

1.  Describe state.
    State is the state of the app... or more precisely, it is the state of the initial data of the app. They hold the data. It is a feature only available to classes and the react.js team says it is similar to props, but it is private and "fully controlled by the component"

1.  Describe props.
    Props are properties. They are what is being passed from component to component. They are the foot soldiers while the state is the head of state... no pun intended, that goes out to do the will of the head of state to do whatever that was given to them to give to others.
